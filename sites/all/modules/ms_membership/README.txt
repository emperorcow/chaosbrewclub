role for as long as the plan is active. If the Membership Plan expires, then the
role is removed.

Using any of the various access control modules which Drupal supports (such as the
Content Access module), you can restrict access to various areas and functionalities
of your site using the Permissions system.

Install the module just like you would any other Drupal Module
